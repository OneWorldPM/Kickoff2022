                <p>As a company, we’ve taken many steps over the last two years to ensure the safety and health of our employees during COVID-19—and our approach to planning for the upcoming 2022 Commercial Kickoff has been no different. </p>
                <p>As you prepare to travel to the event, know that we are closely monitoring the spread and severity of COVID-19 in Anaheim and around the country. </p>

                    <li><strong>
                            We are requiring that all attendees show proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken before your inbound travel to Anaheim for the meeting. If you are arriving in Anaheim on Sunday, Feb. 20 or Monday,
                            Feb. 21—you need to test no sooner than Thursday, Feb. 17. If you are arriving in Anaheim on Tuesday, Feb. 22 or Wednesday, Feb. 23—you need to test no sooner than Friday, Feb. 18. </strong>

                    <li>
                        Agiliti will not cover the cost of last-minute testing so please plan ahead.
                        We recommend securing the first available appointment at CVS or Walgreens, or a similar pharmacy, on the day you are going in for your test.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Once you have your test results, forward them to <a class="text-neon-blue" href="mailto:Jenny.Westberg@agilitihealth.com">Jenny.Westberg@agilitihealth.com</a>.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    With the official lifting of CA state masking mandates, onsite masking and testing will be left to individual choice. We will provide mechanisms to enable those choices (by providing optional
                    masks and a testing location). Beyond that, the company will not enforce masking or testing requirements onsite during the meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your continued understanding and patience as we respond to COVID-19.
